Motivate and abstractly describe the problem you are addressing and how you are addressing it. What is the problem? Why is it important? What is your basic approach? A short discussion of how it fits into related work in the area is also desirable. Summarize the basic results and conclusions that you will present. 


There are approximately 200 million active users on Twitter and 400 million tweets are posted on a daily basis. With such a large volume of tweets there is huge potential for gathering information about public sentiment. We’d like to know whether our machine learning tools can  viably be used to leverage this data and predict public opinion. The specific domain of weather is particularly rich – weather is a common topic of conversation, and this is no different in the Twitter sphere. We seek to predict the sentiment, time frame, and weather condition of tweets given prior data, and cater our off-the-shelf learning algorithms to this unique setting.

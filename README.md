Twitter_Weather_Predictor
=========================

Using over 100,000 weather related tweets as learning data, we created a classifier to generate the sentiment, time frame, and weather for tweets. To build this classifier, we tested Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree algorithms to discover which one most accurately predicts labels for tweets.
